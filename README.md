# Equality-Compass
An in-development Firefox plugin that scans job sites for the United States and assigns them a corresponding color based on the Movement Advancement Projectâ€™s score for LGBTQ+ rights within that state to allow LGBTQ+ folk to make more informed decisions on job applications.

# Advanced Information
+ No use of innerHTML, the locations are processed as plaintext and when inserted it is not executed as code, avoiding most XSS attempts (if LinkedIn is putting XSS attacks as location data we have bigger issues).
+ Styling and Tooltips are both hardcoded to prevent injection.
+ No remote code, everything is local to the machine.

# Installation
